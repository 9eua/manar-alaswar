							<h2>Pipeline Integrity</h2>
					  </div>
						<div class="bold-text">
Our company with the associates/partners are presenting in the global markets a world class services in the Pipeline Integrity and its related areas which are covering a range of consulting, training, engineering solutions, products as well as services to meet the full confident of our customers. 
</div>
						<div class="text">
						  <h2>Pipeline baseline assessment </h2>
						  <p>Soil stress and excessive operating temperatures can damage pipe coating and expose pipe to external corrosion. Water and corrosive contaminants in the product stream can cause internal corrosion damage. High operating stress levels in conjunction with environments conducive for stress corrosion cracking can cause cracking failures.
						    Regular pipeline assessment is critical in order to mitigate these issues. our company offers engineering assessment, data analysis and management for baseline assessment and reassessment programs. </p>
						  <h2>External Corrosion direct assessment (ECDA) </h2>
						  <p>Our company is a world class leading provider of external corrosion direct assessment (ECDA) related engineering, surveys and data analysis, inspection and remediation. Our Pipeline Services Division includes numerous personnel with more than 20 years' experience in pipeline testing and integrity assessments. </p>
						  <p>Our ECDA services include:
•	Pre-assessment
•	Indirect examination
◦ CIS potential surveys
◦	DCVG surveys
◦	Electromagnetic surveys

 </p>
						  <h2>Internal Corrosion direct assessment (ICDA) </h2>
						  <p>Our team of internal corrosion experts provide comprehensive solutions for internal pipeline integrity. These services cover initial corrosion assessment and testing, design and planning of mitigation programs and measurement of the efficacy of corrosion control efforts.
						    Starting with internal corrosion direct assessment (ICDA) to identify maximum risk locations, the control of internal corrosion in pipelines is optimized by one or more of the following activities:
						    •	Pipeline system evaluation and assessment
						    •	Engineering calculations </p>
						  <p>◦	Prediction of corrosivity
• Laboratory analysis of gas, liquids and solids
•	Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) testing, studies and evaluation
•	Corrosion monitoring
◦	Coupons
◦	Probes
◦	NDT (nondestructive testing, in-line inspection, ultrasonic)
•	Cleaning pig programs
•	Application of inhibitors and bacteriacides
 </p>
						  <h2>In-Line inspection data assessment </h2>
						  <p>Our company is one of the nation's leading pipeline inspection companies providing pipeline integrity inspection services. Our Pipeline Services Division has managed in-line inspection projects for more than 15 years and has processed in-line inspection data for more than 12,000 miles of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines.
